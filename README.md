# Networks: A Love Story

## How to get this tutorial _started_. Choose your adventure:

### 1. "I'm not that experienced with git and python."

Not quite sure what "clone the repo" means? Here's what to do:

0. Do you have a folder on your computer where you usually code in? Great! If not, go ahead and create a `CODE` folder on your desktop. We will be working here for this tutorial.

1. Open up a terminal window and navigate to the folder where you expect to do your coding (in this example "CODE") `cd ~/Desktop/CODE/`

2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jkbren/networks_and_dataviz`

3. Navigate into the repository: `cd networks_and_dataviz`

4. Install the software: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Start up the jupyter notebook! `jupyter notebook`

### 2. "I'm comfortable with git and python."

To install the software for this tutorial, clone the repo and run the following:

```
cd networks_and_dataviz
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. "I don't want to live-code this tutorial."

Follow along in the jupyter notebook [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jkbren/networks_and_dataviz/blob/master/network-tutorial.ipynb?flush_cache=true)!

## UPDATE (January, 2020):
Included at the bottom of the Jupyter notebook above are four new datasets and associated visuals. They require a little more data processing, and some extra packages to install if you don't already have them. They're intened to be illustrative of the cool things you can do with python and matplotlib.
